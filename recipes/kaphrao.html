		<p>Thai basil chicken is a stir-fry dish made with finely chopped or ground chicken cooked with chile peppers, garlic, and shallots, and seasoned with a sweet and salty sauce and finished with fresh basil. It's a classic dish in Thai cuisine and can be found in restaurants and as a popular street food.
		</p>
		<p>
		Thai basil has a mildly spicy licorice or anise seed flavor. Sweet basil (also known as Italian basil) tastes sweet and peppery. Holy basil (also called Thai holy basil) tastes of pepper and cloves.

		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>⅓ cup chicken broth
			<li>1 tablespoon oyster sauce
			<li>1 tablespoon soy sauce, or as needed
			<li>2 teaspoons fish sauce
			<li>1 teaspoon white sugar
			<li>1 teaspoon brown sugar
			<li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil
			<li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs, coarsely chopped
			<li>¼ cup sliced shallots
			<li>4 cloves garlic, minced
			<li>2 tablespoons minced Thai chilies, Serrano, or other hot pepper
			<li>1 cup very thinly sliced fresh basil leaves
			<li>2 cups hot cooked rice
		</ul>	
		<h3>Directions</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Gather ingredients.
			<li>Whisk chicken broth, oyster sauce, soy sauce, fish sauce, white sugar, and brown sugar together in a bowl until well blended.
			<li>Heat large skillet over high heat. Drizzle in oil. Add chicken and stir fry until it loses its raw color, 2 to 3 minutes.
			<li>Stir in shallots, garlic, and sliced chilies. Continue cooking on high heat until some of the juices start to caramelize in the bottom of the pan, about 2 or 3 more minutes.

			<li>Serve hot and enjoy!
